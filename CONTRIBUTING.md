## Pick an appropriate issue

If you take a look at the issues list, there are some with the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/labels/good%20first%20issue) tag. You can pick any issue you feel confident in tackling, or even create your own issue. However, the ones marked with `good first issue` are created with newcomers in mind.

Once you've identified an issue that you're interested in working on, leave a comment on the issue letting others know. This will prevent multiple people accidentally working on the same issue.

### What if there are no appropriate issues?

There are always ways to improve a project:

- Can code coverage be improved?
- Is documentation lacking?
- Are there any typos?
- Can any code be optimised or cleaned up?

If you can identify any areas of improvement, create an issue.

## Tips for Pull Requests (PRs)

### Try to keep PRs simple

The maintainers do it alongside a day job, so very large PRs may take a long time to review. We try to leave feedback on PRs within a few days of them being opened to keep things flowing.

### A PR doesn't have to be perfect before opening it

It's often better to open a pull request with a simple prototype, and get feedback.

### Avoid overly complex code

Part of open source's appeal is anyone can contribute to it. To keep a codebase clean and maintainable, it's a constant battle to keep complexity in check. Bear this in mind when doing a PR. The code should be high quality and well documented.

## What if my code doesn't get merged?

Most contributions get merged. However, a PR can serve many purposes - it can spark discussion and ideas. There is no wasted effort in open source, as it always contributes to collective learning. If a PR doesn't get merged, it's usually because we decide on a different approach for solving the problem, or the complexity overhead with adding it outweighs the benefits.

## Contributing without writing code

Even without writing code there are lots of ways to get involved.

### Documentation

Is something in the documentation unclear or missing? These types of contributions are invaluable.

### Design input

Is there something about the design which you don't like? Getting constructive user feedback is incredibly useful.

### Tutorials

Can you write a blog article or tutorial about Piccolo?

### Spreading the word

Just starring the project or a tweet helps us a lot.

## Git usage

If you're not confident with Git, then the [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) is highly recommended.

---

## Project setup

See the main [Piccolo docs](https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/contributing/index.html).

---

## Sister projects

The main Piccolo repo is just one piece of the ecosystem. There are other essential components which are open to contributions:

- https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo_admin
- https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo_api

## Becoming a project member

There is no formal process for becoming a project member. Typically people become members after making significant contributions to the project, or who require specific permissions which makes contributing to Piccolo easier.
