Changes
=======

0.16.5
------
The Postgres extensions that ``PostgresEngine`` tries to enable at startup
can now be configured.

0.16.4
------
 * Fixed a bug with ``MyTable.column != None``
 * Added ``is_null`` and ``is_not_null`` methods, to avoid linting issues when
   comparing with None.

0.16.3
------
 * Added ``WhereRaw``, so raw SQL can be used in where clauses.
 * ``piccolo shell run`` now uses syntax highlighting - courtesy of Fingel.

0.16.2
------
Reordering the dependencies in requirements.txt when using ``piccolo asgi new``
as the latest FastAPI and Starlette versions are incompatible.

0.16.1
------
Added ``Timestamptz`` column type, for storing datetimes which are timezone
aware.

0.16.0
------
 * Fixed a bug with creating a ``ForeignKey`` column with ``references="self"``
   in auto migrations.
 * Changed migration file naming, so there are no characters in there which
   are unsupported on Windows.

0.15.1
------
Changing the status code when creating a migration, and no changes were
detected. It now returns a status code of 0, so it doesn't fail build scripts.

0.15.0
------
Added ``Bytea`` / ``Blob`` column type.

0.14.13
-------
Fixing a bug with migrations which drop column defaults.

0.14.12
-------
 * Fixing a bug where re-running ``Table.create(if_not_exists=True)`` would
   fail if it contained columns with indexes.
 * Raising a ``ValueError`` if a relative path is provided to ``ForeignKey``
   ``references``. For example, ``.tables.Manager``. The paths must be absolute
   for now.

0.14.11
-------
Fixing a bug with ``Boolean`` column defaults, caused by the ``Table``
metaclass not being explicit enough when checking falsy values.

0.14.10
-------
 * The ``ForeignKey`` ``references`` argument can now be specified using a
   string, or a ``LazyTableReference`` instance, rather than just a ``Table``
   subclass. This allows a ``Table`` to be specified which is in a Piccolo app,
   or Python module. The ``Table`` is only loaded after imports have completed,
   which prevents circular import issues.
 * Faster column copying, which is important when specifying joins, e.g.
   ``await Band.select(Band.manager.name).run()``.
 * Fixed a bug with migrations and foreign key contraints.

0.14.9
------
Modified the exit codes for the ``forwards`` and ``backwards`` commands when no
migrations are left to run / reverse. Otherwise build scripts may fail.

0.14.8
------
 * Improved the method signature of the ``output`` query clause (explicitly
   added args, instead of using ``**kwargs``).
 * Fixed a bug where ``output(as_list=True)`` would fail if no rows were found.
 * Made ``piccolo migrations forwards`` command output more legible.
 * Improved renamed table detection in migrations.
 * Added the ``piccolo migrations clean`` command for removing orphaned rows
   from the migrations table.
 * Fixed a bug where ``get_migration_managers`` wasn't inclusive.
 * Raising a ``ValueError`` if ``is_in`` or ``not_in`` query clauses are passed
   an empty list.
 * Changed the migration commands to be top level async.
 * Combined ``print`` and ``sys.exit`` statements.

0.14.7
------
 * Added missing type annotation for ``run_sync``.
 * Updating type annotations for column default values - allowing callables.
 * Replaced instances of ``asyncio.run`` with ``run_sync``.
 * Tidied up aiosqlite imports.

0.14.6
------
 * Added JSON and JSONB column types, and the arrow function for JSONB.
 * Fixed a bug with the distinct clause.
 * Added ``as_alias``, so select queries can override column names in the
   response (i.e. SELECT foo AS bar from baz).
 * Refactored JSON encoding into a separate utils file.

0.14.5
------
 * Removed old iPython version recommendation in the ``piccolo shell run`` and
   ``piccolo playground run``, and enabled top level await.
 * Fixing outstanding mypy warnings.
 * Added optional requirements for the playground to setup.py

0.14.4
------
 * Added ``piccolo sql_shell run`` command, which launches the psql or sqlite3
   shell, using the connection parameters defined in ``piccolo_conf.py``.
   This is convenient when you want to run raw SQL on your database.
 * ``run_sync`` now handles more edge cases, for example if there's already
   an event loop in the current thread.
 * Removed asgiref dependency.

0.14.3
------
 * Queries can be directly awaited - ``await MyTable.select()``, as an
   alternative to using the run method ``await MyTable.select().run()``.
 * The ``piccolo asgi new`` command now accepts a ``name`` argument, which is
   used to populate the default database name within the template.

0.14.2
------
 * Centralised code for importing Piccolo apps and tables - laying the
   foundation for fixtures.
 * Made orjson an optional dependency, installable using
   ``pip install piccolo[orjson]``.
 * Improved version number parsing in Postgres.

------

0.14.0
------
Added ``Interval`` column type.

------

0.13.3
------
Added ``piccolo shell run`` command for running adhoc queries using Piccolo.

0.13.2
------
 * Fixing bug with auto migrations when dropping columns.
 * Added a ``root`` argument to ``piccolo asgi new``, ``piccolo app new`` and
   ``piccolo project new`` commands, to override where the files are placed.

0.13.1
------
Added support for ``group_by`` and ``Count`` for aggregate queries.

0.13.0
------
Added `required` argument to ``Column``. This allows the user to indicate which
fields must be provided by the user. Other tools can use this value when
generating forms and serialisers.

0.12.6
------
 * Fixing a typo in ``TimestampCustom`` arguments.
 * Fixing bug in ``TimestampCustom`` SQL representation.
 * Added more extensive deserialisation for migrations.

0.12.5
------
 * Improved ``PostgresEngine`` docstring.
 * Resolving rename migrations before adding columns.
 * Fixed bug serialising ``TimestampCustom``.
 * Fixed bug with altering column defaults to be non-static values.
 * Removed ``response_handler`` from ``Alter`` query.

0.12.4
------
Using orjson for JSON serialisation when using the ``output(as_json=True)``
clause. It supports more Python types than ujson.

0.12.3
------
Improved ``piccolo user create`` command - defaults the username to the current
system user.

0.12.2
------
Fixing bug when sorting ``extra_definitions`` in auto migrations.

 * Improved ASGI template for FastAPI.

0.11.8
------

0.11.7

   to make the type more explicit for the engine.
 * Removed SQLite as an option for ``piccolo asgi new`` until auto migrations
   are supported.

0.11.6
------
Added support for FastAPI to ``piccolo asgi new``.

0.11.5
------
Fixed bug in ``BaseMigrationManager.get_migration_modules`` - wasn't
excluding non-Python files well enough.

0.11.4
------
 * Stopped ``piccolo migrations new`` from creating a config.py file - was
   legacy.
 * Added a README file to the `piccolo_migrations` folder in the ASGI template.
