Piccolo Apps
############

By leveraging Piccolo apps you can:

* Modularise your code.
* Share your apps with other Piccolo users.
* Unlock some useful functionality like auto migrations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***************
Creating an app
***************

Run the following command within your project:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo app new my_app


Where ``my_app`` is your new app's name. This will create a folder like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    my_app/
        __init__.py
        piccolo_app.py
        piccolo_migrations/
            __init__.py
        tables.py


It's important to register your new app with the ``APP_REGISTRY`` in
``piccolo_conf.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    # piccolo_conf.py
    APP_REGISTRY = AppRegistry(apps=['my_app.piccolo_app'])


Anytime you invoke the ``piccolo`` command, you will now be able to perform
operations on your app, such as :ref:`Migrations`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*********
AppConfig
*********

Inside your app's ``piccolo_app.py`` file is an ``AppConfig`` instance. This is
how you customise your app's settings.

.. code-block:: python

    # piccolo_app.py
    import os

    from piccolo.conf.apps import AppConfig
    from .tables import (
        Author,
        Post,
        Category,
        CategoryToPost,
    )


    CURRENT_DIRECTORY = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))


    APP_CONFIG = AppConfig(
        app_name='blog',
        migrations_folder_path=os.path.join(CURRENT_DIRECTORY, 'piccolo_migrations'),
        table_classes=[Author, Post, Category, CategoryToPost],
        migration_dependencies=[],
        commands=[]
    )

app_name
========

This is used to identify your app, when using the ``piccolo`` CLI, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo migrations forwards blog

migrations_folder_path
======================

Specifies where your app's migrations are stored. By default, a folder called
``piccolo_migrations`` is used.

table_classes
=============

Use this to register your app's ``Table`` subclasses. This is important for
auto migrations (see :ref:`Migrations`).

You can register them manually, see the example above, or can use
``table_finder``.

.. _TableFinder:

table_finder
------------

Instead of manually registering ``Table`` subclasses, you can use
``table_finder`` to automatically import any ``Table`` subclasses from a given
list of modules.

.. code-block:: python

    from piccolo.conf.apps import table_finder

    APP_CONFIG = AppConfig(
        app_name='blog',
        migrations_folder_path=os.path.join(CURRENT_DIRECTORY, 'piccolo_migrations'),
        table_classes=table_finder(modules=['blog.tables']),
        migration_dependencies=[],
        commands=[]
    )

The module path should be from the root of the project (the same directory as
your ``piccolo_conf.py`` file, rather than a relative path).

You can filter the ``Table`` subclasses returned using tags (see :ref:`TableTags`).

Source
~~~~~~

.. currentmodule:: piccolo.conf.apps

.. autofunction:: table_finder


migration_dependencies
======================

Used to specify other Piccolo apps whose migrations need to be run before the
current app's migrations.

commands
========

You can register functions and coroutines, which are automatically added to
the ``piccolo`` CLI.

The `targ <http://targ.readthedocs.io/>`_ library is used under the hood. It
makes it really easy to write command lines tools - just use type annotations
and docstrings. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    def say_hello(name: str):
        """
        Say hello.

        :param name:
            The person to greet.

        """
        print("hello,", name)

We then register it with the ``AppConfig``.

.. code-block:: python

    # piccolo_app.py

    APP_CONFIG = AppConfig(
        # ...
        commands=[say_hello]
    )

And from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> piccolo my_app say_hello bob
    hello, bob

If the code contains an error to see more details in the output add a ``--trace``
flag to the command line.

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> piccolo my_app say_hello bob --trace


By convention, store the command definitions in a ``commands`` folder in your
app.

.. code-block:: bash

    my_app/
        __init__.py
        piccolo_app.py
        commands/
            __init__.py
            say_hello.py

Piccolo itself is bundled with several apps - have a look at the source code
for inspiration.

************
Sharing Apps
************

By breaking up your project into apps, the project becomes more maintainable.
You can also share these apps between projects, and they can even be installed
using pip.
