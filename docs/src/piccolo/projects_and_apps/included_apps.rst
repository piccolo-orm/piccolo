Included Apps
=============

Just as you can modularise your own code using :ref:`apps<PiccoloApps>`, Piccolo itself
ships with several builtin apps, which provide a lot of its functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auto includes
-------------

The following are registered with your :ref:`AppRegistry<AppRegistry>` automatically.

.. hint:: To find out more about each of these commands you can use the
    ``--help`` flag on the command line. For example ``piccolo app new --help``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

app
~~~

Lets you create new Piccolo apps. See :ref:`PiccoloApps`.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo app new

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

asgi
~~~~

Lets you scaffold an ASGI web app. See :ref:`ASGICommand`.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo asgi new

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _Fixtures:

fixtures
~~~~~~~~

Fixtures are used when you want to seed your database with essential data (for
example, country names).

Once you have created a fixture, it can be used by your colleagues when setting
up an application on their local machines, or when deploying to a new
environment.

Databases such as Postgres have built-in ways of dumping and restoring data
(via ``pg_dump`` and ``pg_restore``). Some reasons to use the fixtures app
instead:

* When you want the data to be loadable in a range of database types and
  versions.
* Fixtures are stored in JSON, which are a bit friendlier for source control.

dump
^^^^

To dump the data into a new fixture file:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo fixtures dump > fixtures.json

By default, the fixture contains data from all apps and tables. You can specify
a subset of apps and tables instead, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo fixtures dump --apps=blog --tables=Post > fixtures.json

Or for multiple apps / tables:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo fixtures dump --apps=blog,shop --tables=Post,Product > fixtures.json


load
^^^^

To load the fixture:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo fixtures load fixtures.json

If you load the fixture again, you will get primary key errors because the rows
already exist in the database. But what if we need to run it again, because we
had a typo in our fixture, or were missing some data? We can upsert the data
using ``--on_conflict``.

There are two options:

1. ``DO NOTHING`` - if any of the rows already exist in the database, just
   leave them as they are, and don't raise an exception.
2. ``DO UPDATE`` - if any of the rows already exist in the database, override
   them with the latest data in the fixture file.

.. code-block:: bash

    # DO NOTHING
    piccolo fixtures load fixtures.json --on_conflict='DO NOTHING'

    # DO UPDATE
    piccolo fixtures load fixtures.json --on_conflict='DO UPDATE'

And finally, if you're loading a really large fixture, you can specify the
``chunk_size``. By default, Piccolo inserts up to 1,000 rows at a time, as
the database adapter will complain if a single insert query is too large. So
if your fixture containts 10,000 rows, this will mean 10 insert queries.

You can tune this number higher or lower if you want (lower if the
table has a lot of columns, or higher if the table has few columns).

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo fixtures load fixtures.json --chunk_size=500

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

meta
~~~~

Tells you which version of Piccolo is installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo meta version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

Lets you create and run migrations. See :ref:`Migrations`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

playground
~~~~~~~~~~

Lets you learn the Piccolo query syntax, using an example schema. See
:ref:`Playground`.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo playground run

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

project
~~~~~~~

Lets you create a new ``piccolo_conf.py`` file. See :ref:`PiccoloProjects`.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo project new

.. _SchemaApp:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

schema
~~~~~~

generate
^^^^^^^^

Lets you auto generate Piccolo ``Table`` classes from an existing database.
Make sure the credentials in ``piccolo_conf.py`` are for the database you're
interested in, then run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo schema generate > tables.py

.. warning:: This feature is still a work in progress. However, even in it's
    current form it will save you a lot of time. Make sure you check the
    generated code to make sure it's correct.

graph
^^^^^

A basic schema visualisation tool. It prints out the contents of a GraphViz dot
file representing your schema.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo schema graph

You can pipe the output to your clipboard (``piccolo schema graph | pbcopy``
on a Mac), then paste it into a `website like this <https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline>`_
to turn it into an image file.

Or if you have `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/download/>`_ installed on your
machine, you can do this to create an image file:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo schema graph | dot -Tpdf -o graph.pdf

Here's an example of a generated image:

.. image:: ./images/schema_graph_output.png
    :target: /_images/schema_graph_output.png

.. note::

   There is a `video tutorial on YouTube <https://youtu.be/Y9vaS4nnQGE>`__.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

shell
~~~~~

Launches an iPython shell, and automatically imports all of your registered
``Table`` classes. It's great for running adhoc database queries using Piccolo.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo shell run

.. note::

   There is a `video tutorial on YouTube <https://youtu.be/NvLFN6Gg7b8>`__.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sql_shell
~~~~~~~~~

Launches a SQL shell (``psql`` or ``sqlite3`` depending on the engine), using
the connection settings defined in ``piccolo_conf.py``. It's convenient if you
need to run raw SQL queries on your database.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo sql_shell run

For it to work, the underlying command needs to be on the path (i.e. ``psql``
or ``sqlite3`` depending on which you're using).

.. note::

   There is a `video tutorial on YouTube <https://youtu.be/NvLFN6Gg7b8>`__.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _TesterApp:

tester
~~~~~~

Launches `pytest <https://pytest.org/>`_ , which runs your unit test suite. The
advantage of using this rather than running ``pytest`` directly, is the
``PICCOLO_CONF`` environment variable will automatically be set before the
testing starts, and will be restored to it's initial value once the tests
finish.

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo tester run

Setting the :ref:`PICCOLO_CONF<PICCOLO_CONF>` environment variable means your
code will use the database engine specified in that file for the duration of
the testing.

By default ``piccolo tester run`` sets ``PICCOLO_CONF`` to
``'piccolo_conf_test'``, meaning that a file called ``piccolo_conf_test.py``
will be imported.

Within the ``piccolo_conf_test.py`` file, override the database settings, so it
uses a test database:

.. code-block:: python

    from piccolo_conf import *

    DB = PostgresEngine(
        config={
            "database": "my_app_test"
        }
    )


If you prefer, you can set a custom ``PICCOLO_CONF`` value:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo tester run --piccolo_conf=my_custom_piccolo_conf

You can also pass arguments to pytest:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo tester run --pytest_args="-s foo"

Optional includes

:ref:`Authentication`.
