Supported Databases
===================

Postgres
--------
Postgres is the primary focus for Piccolo, and is what we expect most people
will be using in production.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cockroach DB
------------
Cockroach support is in experimental beta.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQLite
------
SQLite support is not as complete as Postgres, but it is available - mostly
because it's easy to setup.
