Database Support
================

`Postgres <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ is the primary database which Piccolo
was designed for.

`CockroachDB <https://www.cockroachlabs.com/>`_ is in experimental beta.

Limited `SQLite <https://www.sqlite.org/index.html>`_ support is available,
mostly to enable tooling like the :ref:`playground <Playground>`. Postgres is the only database we
recommend for use in production with Piccolo.
