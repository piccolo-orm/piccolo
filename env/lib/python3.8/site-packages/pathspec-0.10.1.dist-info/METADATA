PathSpec
========

*pathspec* is a utility library for pattern matching of file paths. So
far this only includes Git's wildmatch pattern matching which itself is
derived from Rsync's wildmatch. Git uses wildmatch for its `gitignore`_
files.

.. _`gitignore`: http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore


Tutorial
--------

Say you have a "Projects" directory and you want to back it up, but only
certain files, and ignore others depending on certain conditions::

	>>> import pathspec
	>>> # The gitignore-style patterns for files to select, but we're including
	>>> # instead of ignoring.
	>>> spec_text = """
	...
	... # This is a comment because the line begins with a hash: "#"
	...
	... # Include several project directories (and all descendants) relative to
	... # the current directory. To reference a directory you must end with a
	... # slash: "/"
	... /project-a/
	... /project-b/
	... /project-c/
	...
	... # Patterns can be negated by prefixing with exclamation mark: "!"
	...
	... # Ignore temporary files beginning or ending with "~" and ending with
	... # ".swp".
	... !~*
	... !*~
	... !*.swp
	...
	... # These are python projects so ignore compiled python files from
	... # testing.
	... !*.pyc
	...
	... # Ignore the build directories but only directly under the project
	... # directories.
	... !/*/build/
	...
	... """

We want to use the ``GitWildMatchPattern`` class to compile our patterns. The
``PathSpec`` class provides an interface around pattern implementations::

	>>> spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines(pathspec.patterns.GitWildMatchPattern, spec_text.splitlines())

That may be a mouthful but it allows for additional patterns to be implemented
in the future without them having to deal with anything but matching the paths
sent to them. ``GitWildMatchPattern`` is the implementation of the actual
pattern which internally gets converted into a regular expression. ``PathSpec``
is a simple wrapper around a list of compiled patterns.

To make things simpler, we can use the registered name for a pattern class
instead of always having to provide a reference to the class itself. The
``GitWildMatchPattern`` class is registered as **gitwildmatch**::

	>>> spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines('gitwildmatch', spec_text.splitlines())

If we wanted to manually compile the patterns we can just do the following::

	>>> patterns = map(pathspec.patterns.GitWildMatchPattern, spec_text.splitlines())
	>>> spec = PathSpec(patterns)

``PathSpec.from_lines()`` is simply a class method which does just that.

If you want to load the patterns from file, you can pass the file instance
directly as well::

	>>> with open('patterns.list', 'r') as fh:
	>>>     spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines('gitwildmatch', fh)

You can perform matching on a whole directory tree with::

	>>> matches = spec.match_tree('path/to/directory')

Or you can perform matching on a specific set of file paths with::

	>>> matches = spec.match_files(file_paths)

Or check to see if an individual file matches::

	>>> is_matched = spec.match_file(file_path)

There is a specialized class, ``pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec``, which more closely
implements the behavior of **gitignore**. This uses ``GitWildMatchPattern``
pattern by default and handles some edge cases differently from the generic
``PathSpec`` class. ``GitIgnoreSpec`` can be used without specifying the pattern
factory::

	>>> spec = pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec.from_lines(spec_text.splitlines())

Change History
==============


0.10.1 (2022-09-02)
-------------------

Bug fixes:

- Fix documentation on `pathspec.pattern.RegexPattern.match_file()`.
- `Issue #60`_: Remove redundant wheel dep from pyproject.toml.
- `Issue #61`_: Dist failure for Fedora, CentOS, EPEL.
- `Issue #62`_: Since version 0.10.0 pure wildcard does not work in some cases.

Improvements:

- Restore support for legacy installations using `setup.py`. See `Issue #61`_.


.. _`Issue #60`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/60
.. _`Issue #61`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/61
.. _`Issue #62`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/62


0.10.0 (2022-08-30)
-------------------

Major changes:

- Dropped support of EOL Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6. See `Issue #47`_.
- The *gitwildmatch* pattern `dir/*` is now handled the same as `dir/`. This means `dir/*` will now match all descendants rather than only direct children. See `Issue #19`_.
- Added `pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec` class (see new features).
- Changed build system to `pyproject.toml`_ and build backend to `setuptools.build_meta`_ which may have unforeseen consequences.
- Renamed GitHub project from `python-path-specification`_ to `python-pathspec`_. See `Issue #35`_.

API changes:

- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.match_files()` is an old function no longer used.
- Deprecated: `pathspec.match_files()` is an old function no longer used.
- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.normalize_files()` is no longer used.
- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.iter_tree()` is an alias for `pathspec.util.iter_tree_files()`.
- Deprecated: `pathspec.iter_tree()` is an alias for `pathspec.util.iter_tree_files()`.
-	Deprecated: `pathspec.pattern.Pattern.match()` is no longer used. Use or implement
	`pathspec.pattern.Pattern.match_file()`.

New features:

- Added class `pathspec.gitignore.GitIgnoreSpec` (with alias `pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec`) to implement *gitignore* behavior not possible with standard `PathSpec` class. The particular *gitignore* behavior implemented is prioritizing patterns matching the file directly over matching an ancestor directory.

Bug fixes:

- `Issue #19`_: Files inside an ignored sub-directory are not matched.
- `Issue #41`_: Incorrectly (?) matches files inside directories that do match.
- `Issue #51`_: Refactor deprecated unittest aliases for Python 3.11 compatibility.
- `Issue #53`_: Symlink pathspec_meta.py breaks Windows.
- `Issue #54`_: test_util.py uses os.symlink which can fail on Windows.
- `Issue #55`_: Backslashes at start of pattern not handled correctly.
- `Issue #56`_: pyproject.toml: include subpackages in setuptools config
- `Issue #57`_: `!` doesn't exclude files in directories if the pattern doesn't have a trailing slash.

Improvements:

- Support Python 3.10, 3.11.
- Modernize code to Python 3.7.
- `Issue #52`_: match_files() is not a pure generator function, and it impacts tree_*() gravely.
