# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We recommend opening a security advisory on GitHub, as per the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Alternatively, reach out to the maintainers via email (see [setup.py](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/bbd2e4ad6378b2080d58fb7c7ed392f0425f0f21/setup.py#L60) for contact details).
